# Machine Learning as a Pathology Aid: Using ML models to detect breast cancer

This was my final project for my certification in Data Science and AI with the Institute of Data (AUT accredited). 

This project appealed to me as it combined my newfound passion for data science and my background in histology. I compared several models, ranging from simple logistic regression models to more complex convolutional neural networks, assessing their ability to detect breast cancer in histopathology images. 

This was my first attempt working with CNNs, so naturally my initial model required some troubleshooting, and could certainly benefit from some further work. 

I encountered some setbacks, mainly related to my machine's processing power and memory, but I believe work like this could be a valuable addition to the digitisation of histopathology services, improving efficiency and reducing both the workload for pathologists and the wait time for patients.

Notebook: this includes all code written for this project.

Presentation: this is the PowerPoint I created for presenting this project.
